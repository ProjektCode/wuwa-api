# WuwaAPI

Welcome to the WuwaAPI! This is a Fastify-based REST API designed to provide Wuthering Waves game data, directly sourced from game assets. It's built for developers who need quick and reliable access to game information.

## Quickstart

Get the API up and running quickly with these simple steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Start Development Server**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
3.  **Build and Start Production Server**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    npm start
    ```
    The API runs by default on `http://localhost:3000`. You can customize the host and port using the `HOST` and `PORT` environment variables.
